### Welcome to...LinkedOut

We aim to create a database that connects employers and job seekers alike to potential new opportunities and network.

The domain we’re modelling in our project is an online job portal. We’re going to focus on data that’s stored on a website where people can make posts for job openings and apply for jobs.

The aim of the database is to help applicants find jobs online and increase their network through sending messages to other users, as well as helping recruiters find qualified applicants and post job openings with hashtags. Overall, the database aims to make job applications and hiring more streamlined and less complicated.
